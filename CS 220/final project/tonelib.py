# tonelib.py

"""Simple tone generation library for creating, playing, and saving audio tones.

A tone is represented as a list of "samples" of the waveform where
each sample is a floating point number in the range -1 to 1
inclusive. Sampling is done at the standard CD rate of 44100 hz.

The generate_tone function produces a list of samples representing
a tone of a given frequency, duration, and amplitude produced from
a standard wave function.

Filter functions modify a list of samples, for example, by making a
tone "fade-out" or adjusting the overall volume.

write_wavefile writes a list of samples to an uncompressed wav file.

play_sound is a simple function for playing tones. Intended for
testing purposes only.
